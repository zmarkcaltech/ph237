\item
{\bf Radiation from a Spinning Dumbell} \\
There exists a dumbell of length $L$ with a mass $M$ on each end. The
material of the dumbell bar is of negligible mass compared to $M$.
\begin{itemize}

\item[\bf a)] Using the quadrupole approximation, write down and
  expression for the strain at distances far away (relative to the
  wavelength, $\lambda$, of the radiation.

\item[\bf b)] Considering realistic materials, compute the numerical
  value for the strain at a distance of $\sim 3 \lambda$. For the bar
  material you will have to choose a reasonable radius, such that the
  total stress in the bar is less than the yield stress of the
  material.

\end{itemize}

\item
{\bf Binary Stars} \\
Gravitational Radiation from binary stars.
\begin{itemize}

\item[\bf a)] The binary star system $\iota$ Boo is at a distance of
  11.7 pc from the Earth. Assume that each star has a mass of 1
  $M_{\odot}$ and that the system has an orbital period of 6.5
  hours. Compute the frequency and amplitude of the strain as measured
  at the earth.

\item[\bf b)] Assume that the total energy of the binary stars can
  be well estimated by Newtonian mechanics (since they are from each
  other and the velocities are non-relativistic). Compute
  gravitational wave luminosity and, from that, plot the orbital
  radius, $R(t)$.

\end{itemize}


\item
{\bf The Hulse-Taylor Binary} \\
In 1974, Russel Hulse and Joe Taylor discovered a pulsar in orbit
around another neutron star (receiving the 1993 Nobel Prize in
Physics) with a period $P = 7.75$\,hours. The analysis by Taylor and Weisberg in
the subsequent years showed that the decay of this orbit was in
agreement with General Relativity to high accuracy.
\begin{itemize}

\item[\bf a)] Plot the periastron shift as a function of time using
  the data from Zenodo?

\item[\bf b)] Does this agree with GR?

\end{itemize}
